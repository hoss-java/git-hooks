The goal of this card is to improve Git hooks by separating the directives collector from the message formatter.

# DOD (definition of done):
Directives collector has its own script.
All hooks and scripts are updated to use the new Directives collector.

# TODO:
- [x] 1. Move Directives collector from commit-msg-format.shinc to a new shinc (commit-msg-directives.shinc)
- [x] 2. Update commit-msg-format.shinc and commit-msg to use commit-msg-directives.shinc
- [x] 3. Add this system to other hooks such as pre-commit
- [x] 4. Update other files/script if needed
